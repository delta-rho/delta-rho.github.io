A recent issue of Statistical Analysis and Data Mining covers Bill Cleveland's original 2001 data science paper.  Comments from discussants Steve Scott, Scott Vander Wiel, Kary Myers, and Michael Kane can be found [here](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sam.2014.7.issue-6/issuetoc) and Bill's thoughts and reactions, including a lengthy discussion of DeltaRho (then known as Tessera) can be read in a preprint [here](http://ml.stat.purdue.edu/hafen/preprints/Cleveland_SADM_2014.pdf).
