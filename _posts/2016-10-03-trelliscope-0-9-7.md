Trelliscope v0.8.6 has been released to CRAN.  The update contains updates to reflect the new name of the project, DeltaRho, and a new experimental function to convert your visualizaiton database to the next generation Trelliscope viewer (which we will post about soon).  To see what is new in this version look at the package [NEWS](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/trelliscope/news.html).
